# Salary Analysis Project

## Project Summary

This project provides an in-depth analysis of salary data to uncover trends related to job titles, experience, gender, race, and country. The dataset includes columns such as Age, Gender, Education Level, Job Title, Years of Experience, Salary, Country, Race, and Seniority. Through this project, I aimed to gain insights into:
- Which job titles offer the best salary growth.
- How experience levels correlate with salaries.
- How salaries differ across genders, races, and countries.

The project uses various techniques including:
- **Data cleaning and preprocessing** in Python to prepare the data for analysis.
- **Data analysis with MySQL**: Complex SQL queries were used to extract insights like average salaries by job title, country, and gender, as well as ranking job titles by average salary and years of experience.
- **Data visualization in Tableau**: The results were then visualized through interactive and insightful dashboards.

This analysis is beneficial for:
- **Individuals**: Gaining insights into career decision-making based on salary trends.
- **Companies**: Optimizing their hiring strategies and compensation packages.
- **HR departments**: Benchmarking salaries and understanding market trends.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data cleaning and preprocessing using **Pandas** and **NumPy**.
- **MySQL**: Data storage and SQL queries for deeper analysis.
- **Tableau**: Powerful data visualization tool for generating interactive charts and dashboards.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing in Python**: 
   - Removing duplicates and handling missing values.
   - Converting data types for consistent analysis.
   - Standardizing columns (e.g., handling categorical values like 'Male'/'Female' correctly).
   
- **SQL Analysis in MySQL**: 
   - Aggregating salaries by job title, country, and gender.
   - Ranking job titles based on average salary and years of experience.
   - Exploring salary growth trends with respect to experience levels.
   
- **Interactive Tableau Visualizations**: 
   - Salary distribution across different countries and genders.
   - Identifying job titles with the highest average salaries.
   - Visualizing salary growth with experience levels for different job titles.
   - Top-paying jobs by years of experience and seniority.

## Visualizations
- **Salary Distribution by Country and Gender**: Bar charts and pie charts.
- **Top-Paying Jobs in Each Country**: Bar charts showing job titles with the highest salaries.
- **Salary Growth Over Experience**: Line charts showing salary trends over experience for each job title.
- **Top 5 Job Titles by Salary Growth**: Table or bar chart to show the job titles with the highest salary growth over time.

## Conclusion

This project offers valuable insights into salary trends and job markets, allowing professionals and organizations to:
- Make informed career and compensation decisions.
- Benchmark salaries against market standards.
- Visualize salary growth patterns over experience and different countries.

The results from this analysis are meant to guide individuals in career decisions and assist companies in formulating competitive compensation strategies. This data-driven approach is critical for both talent acquisition and retention in an ever-evolving job market.

## Future Improvements
- **Expand Dataset**: Adding more countries and job titles for richer insights.
- **Advanced Predictive Models**: Implementing machine learning to predict future salary trends based on various factors.
- **Include Additional Features**: Explore the impact of education level and industry on salaries.
